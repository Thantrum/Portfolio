              <p class="card-text">
                Meriadoc Brandybuck, usually called Merry, is a Hobbit, a fictional character from
                J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, featured throughout his most famous work,
                The Lord of the Rings. Merry is described as one of the closest friends of Frodo Baggins,
                the main protagonist. Merry and his friend and cousin, Pippin, are members of the Fellowship
                of the Ring. They become separated from the rest of the group and spend much of The Two Towers
                making their own decisions. By the time of The Return of the King, Merry has enlisted in the army
                of Rohan as an esquire to King Th√©oden, in whose service he fights during the War of the Ring.
                After the war, he returns home, where he and Pippin lead the Scouring of the Shire, ridding it of Saruman's influence.

              <h5 class="card-title">Peregrin Took</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Peregrin Took, commonly known simply as Pippin, is a fictional character from
                J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. He is closely tied with
                his friend and cousin, Merry Brandybuck, and the two are together during most of
                the story. Pippin and Merry are introduced as a pair of young hobbits of the Shire
                who become ensnared in their friend Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the One Ring.
                Pippin joins the Fellowship of the Ring. He and Merry become separated from the rest
                of the group at the breaking of the Fellowship and spend much of The Two Towers with
                their own story line. Impetuous and curious, Pippin enlists as a soldier in the army
                of Gondor and fights in the Battle of the Morannon. With the other hobbits, he returns
                home, helps to lead the Scouring of the Shire, and becomes Thain or hereditary leader of the land.
